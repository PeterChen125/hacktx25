Think of it like this: if you're walking forward and spinning at the same time, you need to spin a bit extra to face the same point ahead of you again!

**Magnetars** are neutron stars with extremely powerful magnetic fields - trillions of times stronger than Earth's! They can produce massive starquakes and gamma-ray bursts. Some magnetars also pulse, making them magnetar-pulsar hybrids.

- **Farthest (apogee)**: ~406,700 km (252,700 miles)

That's about 50,000 km difference! To put it in perspective, you could fit about 30 Earths in that gap. The Moon is slowly drifting away from us at about 3.8 cm per year - so in a billion years, it'll be about 38,000 km farther away! üåç‚û°Ô∏èüåô`;
